-------------------------------------------------------
Why?

The Android platform unfortunately ships with a cut-down version of Bouncy Castle - as well as being crippled, it also makes installing an updated version of the libraries difficult due to classloader conflicts.

Spongy Castle is the stock Bouncy Castle libraries with a couple of small changes to make it work on Android:

    all package names have been moved from org.bouncycastle.* to org.spongycastle.* - to avoid classloader conflicts
    the Java Security API Provider name is now SC rather than BC
    no class names change, so the BouncyCastleProvider class remains Bouncy, not Spongy, but moves to the org.spongycastle.jce.provider package.

Download

Spongy Castle artifacts are published on Maven Central. Use Gradle or the android-maven-plugin to make the most of this, or click the jar links below - make sure you include all dependencies:

    core (jar) - Core lightweight API
    prov (jar) - JCE provider (requires core)
    pkix (jar) - PKIX, CMS, EAC, TSP, PKCS, OCSP, CMP, and CRMF APIs (requires prov)
    pg (jar) - OpenPGP API (requires prov)

Using Spongy Castle

Register it just like the standard BouncyCastleProvider, but use insertProviderAt() rather than addProvider(), to ensure that Spongy Castle is used in preference to any other security provider on the device:

static {
    Security.insertProviderAt(new org.spongycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider(), 1);
}

There's an example of Spongy Castle in active use in the ToyAuthAgentService of the toy-android-ssh-agent project. There's also an even simpler demo Eclipse project showing how to include Spongy Castle in a vanilla Eclipse project.
Licence

Spongy Castle uses the same adaptation of the MIT X11 License as Bouncy Castle.

# Introduction
We are testing YAIL at two levels, a full project or a single generator function. Both tests are
not at a unit level, but generator function tests are close to that.
Templates are provided for both types of tests: yailGeneratorTest.template for project tests, and
yailGeneratorUnitTest.template for single generator function tests.

# Dependencies
You will also have to install phantomJS: http://phantomjs.org/download.html

In MacOSX is as simple as: brew install phantomJS (if you are using homebew)
In other platforms just download the package and put the bin folder in your PATH

# Adding new tests to the ant build system
The ant target 'ant tests' will execute all Java tests for the codebase. To execute also
JavaScript tests, they have to be added to the file
.appinventor/blocklyeditor/tests/com/google/appinventor/blocklyeditor/BlocklyEvalTest.java

A test looks like:

    public void testPaintPot() throws Exception {

      String[] params = { "phantomjs", testpath + "/tests/com/google/appinventor/blocklyeditor/paintPotTest.js" };
      String result = "";

      try {
        result = CodeBlocksProcessHelper.exec(params, true).trim();
      } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
      }

      assertEquals("true", result.toString());
    }

# Writing Tests
## Full project tests
These tests can be found at blocklyeditor/tests/com/google/appinventor/blocklyeditor

They take a set of blocks for a project and generate the yail for it. They then check this yail by
applying various tests. For example, checking whether this yail is the same as the yail generated
by the equivalent project in App Inventor 1.

To create a phantomJS test you will need to generate a project first, so that
you have access to an Screen1.scm and Screen1.bky files.

After that, create a new test following the template in this same folder called
./appinventor/blocklyeditor/tests/yailGeneratorTest.template
The test will expect the two files mentioned above as test data, and also an
expected yail file to test against, acquired from App Inventor Classic.

*** Getting the .scm and .bky files:
- Create a new project in App Inventor 2
- When the project is complete, go to 'My Projects', select your project,
and click 'Download Source'
- You will receive a .aia file. This behaves as a .zip file. When unzipped,
navigate through the /src directory which will reveal the .scm and .bky files.
- Put these into a folder in the 'data' directory for the tests; for instance:
[...]/appinventor/blocklyeditor/data/paintPot
- If you are testing, for example, paintPot, name the folder 'paintPot', containing the .scm and .bky files.

*** Getting the Classic .yail: (Optional)
We have been testing some projects based on the YAIL generated by the same project using App
Inventor 1. This will not always be the case, but if that is what you need to do,
you can follow the steps:
- You will need to create the exact same project as in newblocks, but in App Inventor Classic.
- Once complete, you will need to follow similar steps as above to download the
source files, contained in a .zip folder.
- Navigating through the /src directory will reveal a .scm and .blk file. These
will be used to generate Yail.
- Acquire the YailGenerator.jar file, located appinventor/buildserver/build/
- Copy the YailGenerator.jar file to a directory that will be convenient,
preferably containing the .scm and .blk file.
- In Terminal, navigate to where you put your YailGenerator.jar file.
- Use the command:
    java -jar <PATH_TO_YailGenerator.jar> <PATH_TO_Screen1.scm> <PATH_TO_Screen1.blk> fakepackagename > <WHAT_YOU'RE_TESTING>Expected.yail

- If all three files are in the same directory, the command can be as simple as:
    java -jar YailGenerator.jar Screen1.scm Screen1.blk fakepackagename > paintPotExpected.yail
- Copy the XXXXExpected.yail into the folder along with the original .scm and .bky files.

*** Using the template:
- Simply substitute the first three file paths to the corresponding .scm and .bky
files, as well as the expected.yail file.

For an Example, you can see the code in moleMashTest.js, and the accompanying
files inside data/moleMash.

## Generator function tests
These tests can be found at blocklyeditor/tests/com/google/appinventor/generators_unit

They call the yail generator for a specified block, and test that yail against an expected result.

You can create a new test following the template in this same folder called
./appinventor/blocklyeditor/tests/yailGeneratorUnitTest.template

# Description:
appengine.FusiontablesControlHelpStringComponentPallette=<p>A non-visible component that communicates with Google Fusion Tables. Fusion Tables let you store, share, query and visualize data tables; this component lets you query, create, and modify these tables.</p> <p>This component uses the <a href\="https\://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v2/getting_started" target\="_blank">Fusion Tables API V2.0</a>. <p>Applications using Fusion Tables must authentication to Google''s servers. There are two ways this can be done. The first way uses an API Key which you the developer obtain (see below). With this approach end-users must also login to access a Fusion Table. The second approach is to use a Service Account. With this approach you create credentials and a special "Service Account Email Address" which you obtain from the <a href\="https\://code.google.com/apis/console/" target\="_blank">Google APIs Console</a>. You then tell the Fusion Table Control the name of the Service Account Email address and upload the secret key as an asset to your application and set the KeyFile property to point at this file. Finally you check the "UseServiceAuthentication" checkbox in the designer. When using a Service Account, end-users do not need to login to use Fusion Tables, your service account authenticates all access.</p> <p>To get an API key, follow these instructions.</p> <ol><li>Go to your <a href\="https\://code.google.com/apis/console/" target\="_blank">Google APIs Console</a> and login if necessary.</li><li>Select the <i>Services</i> item from the menu on the left.</li><li>Choose the <i>Fusiontables</i> service from the list provided and turn it on.</li><li>Go back to the main menu and select the <i>API Access</i> item. </li></ol><p>Your API Key will be near the bottom of that pane in the section called "Simple API Access".You will have to provide that key as the value for the <i>ApiKey</i> property in your Fusiontables app.</p><p>Once you have an API key, set the value of the <i>Query</i> property to a valid Fusiontables SQL query and call <i>SendQuery</i> to execute the query. App Inventor will send the query to the Fusion Tables server and the <i>GotResult</i> block will fire when a result is returned from the server.Query results will be returned in CSV format, and can be converted to list format using the "list from csv table" or "list from csv row" blocks.</p><p>Note that you do not need to worry about UTF-encoding the query. But you do need to make sure the query follows the syntax described in <a href\="https\://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v2/getting_started" target\="_blank">the reference manual</a>, which means that things like capitalization for names of columns matters, and that single quotes must be used around column names if there are spaces in them.</p>

These elements can be set in the Designer or Blocks Editor by setting the<code>ElementsFromString</code> property to a string-separated concatenation (for example, <em>choice 1, choice 2, choice 3</em>) or by setting the <code>Elements</code> property to a List in the Blocks editor. Spinners are created with the first item already selected. So selecting it does not generate an After Picking event. Consequently it''s useful to make the first Spinner item be a non-choice like "Select from below...". </p>

If <code>ReceivingEnabled</code> is set to 2 messages will be received only when the application is running. Finally if <code>ReceivingEnabled</code> is set to 3, messages will be received when the application is running <b>and</b> when the application is not running they will be queued and a notification displayed to the user.</p> <p>When a message arrives, the <code>MessageReceived</code> event is raised and provides the sending number and message.</p> <p> An app that includes this component will receive messages even when it is in the background (i.e. when it''s not visible on the screen) and, moreso, even if the app is not running, so long as it''s installed on the phone. If the phone receives a text message when the app is not in the foreground, the phone will show a notification in the notification bar. Selecting the notification will bring up the app. As an app developer, you''ll probably want to give your users the ability to control ReceivingEnabled so that they can make the phone ignore text messages.</p> <p>If the GoogleVoiceEnabled property is true, messages can be sent over Wifi using Google Voice. This option requires that the user have a Google Voice account and that the mobile Voice app is installed on the phone. The Google Voice option works only on phones that support Android 2.0 (Eclair) or higher.</p> <p>To specify the phone number (e.g., 650-555-1212), set the <code>PhoneNumber</code> property to a Text string with the specified digits (e.g., 6505551212). Dashes, dots, and parentheses may be included (e.g., (650)-555-1212) but will be ignored; spaces may not be included.</p> <p>Another way for an app to specify a phone number would be to include a <code>PhoneNumberPicker</code> component, which lets the users select a phone numbers from the ones stored in the the phone''s contacts.</p>

appengine.TinyDBHelpStringComponentPallette=TinyDB is a non-visible component that stores data for an app. <p> Apps created with App Inventor are initialized each time they run\: If an app sets the value of a variable and the user then quits the app, the value of that variable will not be remembered the next time the app is run. In contrast, TinyDB is a <em> persistent </em> data store for the app, that is, the data stored there will be available each time the app is run. An example might be a game that saves the high score and retrieves it each time the game is played. </<p> <p> Data items are strings stored under <em>tags</em> . To store a data item, you specify the tag it should be stored under. Subsequently, you can retrieve the data that was stored under a given tag. </p><p> There is only one data store per app. Even if you have multiple TinyDB components, they will use the same data store. To get the effect of separate stores, use different keys. Also each app has its own data store. You cannot use TinyDB to pass data between two different apps on the phone, although you <em>can</em> use TinyDb to shares data between the different screens of a multi-screen app. </p> <p>When you are developing apps using the AI Companion, all the apps using that companion will share the same TinyDb. That sharing will disappear once the apps are packaged. But, during development, you should be careful to clear the TinyDb each time you start working on a new app.</p>

So"en-es" will translate from English to Spanish while "es-ru" will translate from Spanish to Russian. If you leave out the source language, the service will attempt to detect the source language. So providing just "es" will attempt to detect the source language and translate it to Spanish.<p /> This component is powered by the Yandex translation service. See http\://api.yandex.com/translate/ for more information, including the list of available languages and the meanings of the language codes and status codes. <p />Note\: Translation happens asynchronously in the background.
